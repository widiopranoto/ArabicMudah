Please upload the following sound files to this directory for the game audio to work:

- start.wav  (Sound for start game / next chapter)
- on.wav     (Sound for button clicks / next scene)
- chime.wav  (Sound for correct answer)
- alert.wav  (Sound for wrong answer)
- end.wav    (Sound for level completion)
- boom.wav   (Sound for game over / big mistake)

The game will still work without these files, but without audio.
